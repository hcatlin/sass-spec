DEPRECATION WARNING on line 2 of /sass/spec/libsass-issues/issue_2151/input.scss: #{} interpolation near operators will be simplified in a future version of Sass. To preserve the current behavior, use quotes:

  unquote("#{$v} + #{$v} + #{$v} + #{$v} + #{$v}")

You can use the sass-convert command to automatically fix most cases.
